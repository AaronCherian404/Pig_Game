This is a REALLY fun game that you can play with a friend.
The aim of the game to roll a cumulative score of 100 by a dice. The catch? Well, everything a player rolls a 'one', the current score resets to zero 

HOW TO PLAY:-
1) Player 1 always starts first
2) The player can roll the dice as many times as desired.
3) The rolled value will get added to the 'current' score.
4) The catch? Well, once the player rolls a 'one', the 'current' score resets to 0!
5) After each roll, the player has the option to 'hold' the score. 
6) Once the player chooses to hold the score, the points in 'current' score will get added to the player's 'Total' score, and the next player rolls the dice.
7) The turns proceed as above until a player reaches a score greater than or equal to 100! That player wins!

Enjoy!
