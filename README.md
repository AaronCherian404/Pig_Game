HOW TO PLAY:-
1) Player 1 always starts first
2) The player can roll the dice as many times as desired.
3) The rolled value will get added to the 'current' score.
4) If the player rolls a 'one', the 'current' score resets to 0!
5) Hence, after each roll, the player has the option to 'hold' the score. 
6) Once the player chooses to hold the score, the points in 'current' score will get added to the player's 'Total' score, and the next player rolls the dice.
7) The turns proceed as above until a player reaches a score greater than or equal to 100! That player wins!

Enjoy!
